# op_cat-usage-demo
## This repository provides materials describing the whole essence of OP_CAT opcode operation
This example is a demo version of using OP_CAT opcode. All code is written abstractly using the Python language, but that doesn't change the fact that this can be interpreted in TapScript.

Situation: Imagine you have many Bitcoin addresses and you want to create a multisig wallet by combining the public keys of these addresses. Without OP_CAT, this would be maximally inconvenient and lead to less readable code, which in turn can cause problems later on.
